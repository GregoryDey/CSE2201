  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>My name is Gregory Dey, I have attended St. Christopher Nursery, Tucville Primary, St. Johns College and The Government Technical Institute and currently the University of Guyana. I like programming and dabbling in new languages are they are made public. After high school I did work study at the Ministry of Finance, thence to the National Insurance Scheme whilst I signed up in a Perl Programming course to learn web application development in perl. After turning 18 I joined the Government Technical Institute to study Computer Science in the evening, where I learnt C programming and met people with similar interests. I Came across online freelancing tried that part-time. I completed the course at the Government Technical Institute and joined the University of Guyana shortly thereafter, persueing a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. I plan to become proficient at producing 3D art using Blender and Zbrush software packages. </p>
